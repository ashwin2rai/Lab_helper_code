# Lab_helper_code

Set of code snippets to assist in day to day data processing in the AIMS lab at Arizona State University 

The synchDICInstron class is used to synch the CSV files obtained from the Bluehill software from Instron and the CSV files obtained from the ARAMIS software through Digital Image Correlation post processing. The code snippets are written as classes for future addition of features and eventual integrated use.
